# Scan

Once the data source settings are complete, let's check if we can actually perform a scan.

1. Click `Diagnosis > Portscan` in the menu.
2. Click the Portscan list to open the target dialog box you have configured.
    - ![portscan](/img/diagnosis/portscan_scan.png){style="width:400px"}
3. Click `Scan` at the bottom left of the screen.
4. If the status is `OK`, the data linkage has been successful. (If an error is displayed, an error message will be displayed in the dialog box.)
    - The Finding data collected by the data source can be confirmed on the `Finding > Finding` screen.
5. ApplicationScan is not performed automatically. Perform a scan from the screen as necessary.
