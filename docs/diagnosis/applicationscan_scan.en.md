# Scan

After completing the data source configuration, check if you can actually scan.

1. Click `Diagnosis > ApplicationScan` from the menu.
2. Click the ApplicationScan list and open the configured data source dialog.
    - ![applicationscan scan](/img/diagnosis/applicationscan.png){style="width:400px"}
3. Click `Scan` at the bottom left of the screen.
4. If the Status becomes `OK`, data linkage is successful. (*If there is an error display, an error message will be displayed in the dialog.)
    - The Finding data collected by the data source can be checked on the `Finding > Finding` screen.
5. ApplicationScan will not be executed automatically. Scan from the screen as needed.
