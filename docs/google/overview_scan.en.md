# Scan

Once the data source settings are complete, check if scanning is actually possible.

1. Go to the `Google > GCP DataSource` screen.
2. Click on the list of data sources and click `SCAN` in the lower left corner.
3. If the Status column shows `OK`, the integration is successful. (â€» If an error is displayed, an error message will be shown in a dialog box.)
    - ![scan](/img/google/gcp_scan.png){style="width:400px"}
    - Finding data collected by the data source can be confirmed on the `Finding > Finding` screen.
4. In addition to manual scanning, a connected DataSource is periodically executed according to a schedule.
