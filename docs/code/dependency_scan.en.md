# Scan

After completing the data source settings, verify that you can actually perform a scan:

1. Click `Code > GitHub` from the menu.
2. Click the GitHub setting list to open the configured data source dialog.
3. Click `code:dependency` to open the Dependency settings.
4. Click `Scan` at the bottom right of the screen.
5. If the status is `OK`, the data linkage has been successful. (If an error is displayed, an error message will be displayed in the `3. Setting screen`).

   ![GitHub list](/img/code/github_list.png){style="width:600px"}

6. In addition to manual scans like the one above, data sources that have been linked will be executed periodically according to a schedule.
