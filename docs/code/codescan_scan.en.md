# Scanning

Once the data source settings are complete, you'll want to verify if you can actually perform a scan.

1. From the menu, click on `Code > GitHub`.
2. Click on the list of GitHub Settings and open the configured data source dialog.
3. Click on code:codescan to open the CodeScan settings.
4. Click on `Scan` at the bottom left of the screen.
5. If the Status reads `OK`, then it's successful (â€» If there's an error, the error message will be displayed on the `3. settings screen`).

   - The Finding data collected by the data source can be checked under `Finding > Finding`.

6. Besides the manual scan as described above, linked DataSources are also scheduled to run periodically.
