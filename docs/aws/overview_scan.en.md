# AWS Scan

After completing the data source settings, let's check if we can actually scan.

1. Click on the list of various scanners and click `SCAN` on the lower left.
   - ![scan](/img/aws/aws_scan.png){style="width:400px"}
2. If the status column shows `OK`, the integration is successful. (â€» If an error is displayed, an error message will be shown in the dialog.)
   - The finding data collected by the data source can be confirmed on the `Finding > Finding` screen.
3. In addition to manual scanning as described above, data sources that have been integrated will be executed periodically according to the schedule.
