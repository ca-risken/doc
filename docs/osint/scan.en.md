# Scan

Once the data source settings are completed, check if you can actually perform a scan:

1. Click `OSINT > OSINT DataSource` from the menu
2. Click the attached data source to open the dialog box
3. Click `Scan` in the lower left of the dialog box
4. If the Status is `OK`, the data integration is successful (* If an error message is displayed, an error message will be displayed in the dialog box)
    - ![OSINT Scan](/img/osint/osint_scan.png){style="width:450px"}
    - The finding data collected by the data source can be confirmed on the `Finding > Finding` screen
5. In addition to manual scans like the one above, the DataSource that has been linked will be executed on a regular basis (daily) according to the schedule.
